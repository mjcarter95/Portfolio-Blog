Oh what a beautiful morning.

`Oh what a beautiful day`.

I've got a beautiful feeling.

Some Python code is coming your way üêç

```python
def fib():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:            # First iteration:
        yield a            # yield 0 to start with and then
        a, b = b, a + b    # a will now be 1, and b will also be 1, (0 + 1)

for index, fibonacci_number in zip(range(10), fib()):
     print('{i:3}: {f:3}'.format(i=index, f=fibonacci_number))
```
